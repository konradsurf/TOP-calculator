# TOP-calculator
Final project assignment of the Fundamentals portion from
 The Odin project coding bootcamp

Still need/for review:
- account for someone entering a number that is more than one digit - DONE

- do i need the id's on the number buttons? 

- should the decimal (.) be added to numberBtn class?
  - if so, how do i prevent zero from dissapering when event lsitern function
    runs?  perhaps remove but have conditional that if it's a decimal, 
    then add the zero back?


- remove y=2 from enterOperator function
