# TOP-calculator
Final project assignment of the Fundamentals portion from
 The Odin project coding bootcamp

Still need/for review:
- debug calc when using equals sign then operator on result - something fucky when use equal sign then
start doing more operatons - not always, but sometimes the subtotal gets changed to zero. 

- do i need the id's on the number buttons? 

- remove decimal point from buttons

- group varialbe declearations for elements selected with query selector assginmnets? also make sure
not using selectors on the same element twice (unless needed for some reason)
